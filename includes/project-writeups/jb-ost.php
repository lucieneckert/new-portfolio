<p>This is the soundtrack for the first full game I worked on completely solo. Due to
    the fact the game was mostly meant as an experiment in honing game feel, I tried to
    make the music primarily an arcade-y sounding accompaniment to gameplay -- with enough
    variation that it didn't get old too quick. To accomplish this,
    I experimented with a variety of different plugins in LMMS and worked to create an upbeat,
    almost otherwordly vibe to respectively encourage the player and reflect the strangeness of the sort of non-setting the game
    takes place in. In composing each theme for the sets of levels within the game, I tried to increase the
    "intensity" of the music through added sound effects, a faster pace, and fuller chords -- especially for the final level theme.
    For the multiplayer mode background music, I tried to add a more driving, competitive feeling with heavier drums and chords.
    And, uh, for the menu theme, I pretty much tried to emulate Mario Kart Wii.
