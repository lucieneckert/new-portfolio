<h2>Class Projects</h2>

<p>I've taken two web development courses during my time at Cornell,
    <a href="">INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web</a> and
    <a href="">INFO 2300: Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web.</a> Both
    classes had both a design and programming focus, as the names imply. The former
    was focused on static sites, accessibility, and user testing, but the latter got me familiar with server-side
    rendering and sites backed with databases. Here are some of the sites I had to design
    and develop for those classes:

            <figcaption>Second project for 1300. Site designed as a guide for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Third project for 1300. One requirement of the project was client-side interactivity, so I implemented a carousel/slideshow on the homepage.</figcaption>
        </figure>

            <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/p3-mobile.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Third project for 1300. The site was designed to be responsive and support a usable mobile view.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p1.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>First project for 2300. Involved porting the site to PHP, revising the design, and adding new features to meet user needs.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p2.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Second project for 2300. Used SQLite as a development database for a site cataloging information on plants. Involved form validation, adding, retreiving, and filtering records, etc.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p3-0.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Third project for 2300. Built on project 2, added a catalog view of the database records, and refined the site's design based on user feedback.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img class='large' src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p3-1.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Third project for 2300. Built on project 2, added sessions, editing database records, and protection against unauthorized access through SQL injection, accessing pages without permission, etc.</figcaption>
        </figure>

<h2>Many, Many Portfolio Iterations</h2>

<p>I've also gone through many iterations of this very portfolio over the past four years. Some of the earlier ones, uh, definitely demonstrate a
    "learning experience."
</p>

<div class='catalog' id='second-catalog'>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port1.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>It's been a long time since I looked at this. I threw this together quickly freshman year as part of
            an application for the intro Game Design course, as a designer, and I'm not quite sure why they let me in.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port2.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Second portfolio iteration, feels more like a legit website with a list of projects. A very verbose list with not a lot of pictures,
            but certainly an improvement over the previous year's ugly image board.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port3.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Third portfolio iteration -- with a strictly-enforced dark mode. From here on, I began sketching out designs of pages ahead of time, which
            really helped me enforce a style. The little icons in the header would wiggle around when you mouse over them. I kinda miss those guys.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port4.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Fourth iteration. Tried to go for a clean feel with card-like background elements, and vibrant
            colors to make it feel playful. Also, finally moved project info into separate pages. This was about when I realized
            that a database would be far more approprate to generate these article pages dynamically.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port5.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Early version of the current iteration. It's the first version of the portfolio that isn't completely static, using
            PHP to back the list of projects with a simple database and freeing me from cringing at duplicated information. Hope it turns out okay.

<h2>Other Experience</h2>

<p>Besides the experience mentioned above, I've worked with React on some elements of the AI-Learners website for a prior internship. I'm also building
    a website with Ruby on Rails for a game design group I'm part of with a few friends. For different reasons, those projects are less suited for being
    described here, but I'd be happy to talk about them if needed.
