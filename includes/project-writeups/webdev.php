<h2>Class Projects</h2>

<p>I've taken two web development courses during my time at Cornell,
    <a href="">INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web</a> and
    <a href="">INFO 2300: Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web.</a> Both
    classes had both a design and programming focus, as the names imply. The former
    was focused on static sites, accessibility, and user testing, but the latter got me familiar with server-side
    rendering and sites backed with databases. Here are some of the sites I had to design
    and develop for those classes:

        <figcaption>Second project for INFO 1300. Site was designed as a guide for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival. Based on interviews with the user group of Ithaca residents who had previously attended the festival, a common goal was finding new, unique vendors and experiences efficiently. So, my site's design was centered around making it easy to find new vendors though a new/highlighted vendors slideshow on the homepage, and a large visual gallery with expected wait times (pictured) so users could efficiently plan our their route.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Third project for INFO 1300. The main requirement of the project was implementing an element of client-side interactivity in a previous project, so I wrote a carousel/slideshow on the homepage. I made sure this element aligned as closely as possible with common carousel design elements.</figcaption>
    </figure>

        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/p3-mobile.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Third project for INFO 1300. Another requirement was ensuring our site supported mobile devices -- especially important here as users are most likely to access this site on their phones. By moving navigation buttons to a fixed position on the bottom of the screen, the site mirrored the navigational layout of many popular mobile apps to provide a usable mobile experience.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p1.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>First project for INFO 2300. Involved porting a site to PHP (here I used the Apple Harvest Festival site again), revising the design, and adding new features to meet user needs. To do so, I revised the color scheme for greater readability (especially outside) and implemented a "visit" page to provide important information on weather and crowd density. This was the first project during which I used personas in the design process to identify some of these needs.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p2.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Second project for INFO 2300. Used SQLite as a development database for a site cataloging information on plants. Involved form validation, adding, retreiving, and filtering records, etc. supporting a group of users that would maintain this database.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p3-0.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Third project for INFO 2300. Built on project 2, added a catalog view of the database records for a separate user group, and refined the site's design based on user feedback. This was the first project where we had to design a site that supports two distinct user groups, which was challenging.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img class='large' src="public/project-info-res/webdev/2300-p3-1.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Final project for INFO 2300. Built on project 3, with a focus on user authentication, security, and maintenance. Implemented sessions, editing/deleting database records, and protection against unauthorized access through SQL injection or accessing pages / "business logic" without permission, etc.</figcaption>

<h2>Many, Many Portfolio Iterations</h2>

<p>I've also gone through many iterations of this very portfolio over the past four years. Some of the earlier ones, uh, definitely demonstrate a
    "learning experience."
</p>

<div class='catalog' id='second-catalog'>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port1.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>...It's been a long time since I looked at this. I threw this together quickly freshman year as part of
            an application for the intro Game Design course, as a designer, and I'm not quite sure why they let me in.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port2.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Second portfolio iteration, feels a bit more like a legit website with a list of projects. A very verbose list with not a lot of pictures,
            granted, but certainly an improvement over the previous year's clumsy image board.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port3.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Third portfolio iteration -- with a strictly-enforced dark mode. From here on, I began sketching out designs of pages ahead of time, which
            really helped me enforce a style. The little icons in the header would wiggle around when you mouse over them -- very important feature.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port4.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Fourth iteration. Tried to go for a clean feel with card-like background elements, and vibrant
            colors to make it feel visually interesting. Also, finally moved project info into separate pages, which allowed me to describe them in more detail. This was about when I realized
            that a database would be far more approprate to generate these article pages dynamically.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="public/project-info-res/webdev/port5.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Early version of the current iteration. It's the first version of the portfolio that isn't completely static, using
            PHP to back the list of projects with a simple database and freeing me from cringing at duplicated information. Hope it turns out okay.

<h2>Other Experience</h2>

<p>As part of the Marketing subteam at <a href="https://combatrobotics.engineering.cornell.edu/">Combat Robotics at Cornell</a>, I'm leading the project of rebuilding the team's site from the ground up.
    As one of many project teams at Cornell, we're hoping to stand out by using the greater control over functionality and content an in-house website allows us by
    providing unique features like interactive robot galleries and a small web game featuring all our yearly competition robots.
</p>

<p>Besides the experience mentioned above, I've worked with React on elements of the AI-Learners website for a prior internship. I'm also building
    a website with Ruby on Rails for a game design group I'm part of with a few friends. For different reasons, those projects are less suited for being
    described here, but I'd be happy to talk about them if needed.
