    Ragdoll Royale was a project I worked on for <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP22/class/INFO/4152">INFO 4152: Advanced Game Development</a>.
    The game was written in C++ using the course's in-house CUGL engine. I worked on both design and programming tasks for this project, centralizing my
    focus around the game's audio features. As part of the course's requirements, the game targeted mobile devices, which brought with it myriad challenges --
    especially when it came to audio and playtesting.

    Our game was a sort of turn-based drawing/fighting game, supporting up to four player networked multiplayer where each battles to be the last one standing. The gist of the gameplay is that on a player's turn, they can expend ink to draw paths within a limited radius that, upon the end of the turn, drag and fling objects as directed.
    Through this, players can throw objects and characters around the map, whittling away at opponent's health by setting up collisions or planning ahead for combos and chain reactions.
